# 2D Side Scroller

This simple Java application is a work in a progress for a 2D side scrolling game.

As I am currently making changes to the collision detection, activity in the two available levels is very limited.
I am using interpolation which currently works for the x axis however the y axis is still in progress.

## Installation

Download the zip package and extract in a suitable place on your hard drive to be accessed by your IDE. Alternatively can be installed for command line use.

## Usage

Compile the files at the command line using
```
javac MyGame.java
```
Run the program by entering
```
java MyGame
```
